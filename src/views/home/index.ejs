      OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard protocol that allows users to authorize third-party applications to
      access their protected resources, such as data or services, without revealing their login credentials to the
      third-party application. OAuth is widely used in web applications and APIs to enable secure authorization and
      authentication flows. The OAuth protocol involves several actors, including the resource owner (the user who owns
      the protected resource), the client (the third-party application that requests access to the resource), and the
      authorization server (the server that verifies the identity of the user and issues access tokens to the client).
      The OAuth flow typically involves several steps, including user authentication, client authorization, and the
      exchange of access tokens, which the client can use to access the user's protected resources. OAuth provides a
      secure and standardized way for users to share their data and resources with third-party applications without
      compromising their security or privacy.
